### Known Issues
Some packages needs reloading shell (eg. `asdf`) On a fresh macOS you may have to run setup command once, and run again in a new tab which has $PATH reloaded.

### TODOs
- [ ] Modify system preferences
  - Keyboard shortcuts
  - Keyboard layouts
- [ ] Migrate Ansible Playbooks to Dotbot config
- [ ] Add folders to Favorites in Finder
- [ ] Redesign setup script
  - Separate bootstrap script (first run on vanilla) from update script
  - Print readme when bootstrap script is done, eg. login & sync Dropbox & Google Drive & 1Password & Restore mackup
  - Remember & retry on failed step
